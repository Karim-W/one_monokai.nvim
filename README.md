If you like the setting like the image above. Take a look at my [Neovim Configuration](https://github.com/cpea2506/peavim).

### Installation

Install with your favorite package manager:

[packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use 'cpea2506/one_monokai.nvim'
```

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'cpea2506/one_monokai.nvim'
```

### Inspiration
This is the best theme I've ever seen in my eyes. I tried it written in Vim for a long time and found it's not so easy to understand and config. So I decided to write it in Lua for compatibility with neovim 0.5.

Thank for these talented and amazing people.
